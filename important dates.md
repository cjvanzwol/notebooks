- Correction figures of 2 September in the number of confirmed cases
- Nursing homes:
  - "The method used to estimate the numbers of nursing homes and nursing home residents infected with coronavirus has been improved. Since 1 July 2020, for every person newly infected with coronavirus, the municipal health services (GGDs) have noted whether that person lives in a nursing home. Until the end of September 2020, no use was made of this data and a different method was used to calculate infection numbers, which led to a significant overestimate of the number of infected nursing homes. As of 29 September 2020, the estimates on the dashboard from 1 July 2020 onwards have been recalculated using the this data and therefore now give a much better picture of the actual number of infected nursing homes and nursing home residents."
  - "New definition of a nursing home resident: As of 1 July 2020, every time a person tests positive for COVID-19, the GGD asks whether that person is a resident of a nursing home or residential care home for the elderly."
- Number of infectious persons:
  - "Until 30 June this value was based on the daily number of patients admitted to an ICU with COVID-19."
- Sewage water examination:
  - "Please note that the values from before 20 July are based on about 28 sites. The figures between 20 July and 31 August are based on about 80 sites. From 31 August sewage water from about 300 sites is examined."
  - "With the availability of more data, the number of virus particles can be determined more accurately. Therefore, the RIVM has adapted their method to calculate the virus particles per milliliter since 18 August. In the open data file you can see if a measurement in representative of not. For the dashboard we only use representative data."
